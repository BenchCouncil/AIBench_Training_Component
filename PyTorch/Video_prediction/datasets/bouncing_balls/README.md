## Abstract
We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a framework for learning simulators of intuitive physics that naturally generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations. We propose a factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations and a neural network architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics into pairwise interactions. Like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions; realized as a neural network, it can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that the NPE's compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves its ability to predict movement, generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.

### Generating Data
The code to generate data is adapted from the demo code in
[matter-js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js).

This is an example of generating 50000 trajectories of 4 balls of variable mass over 60 timesteps. It will create a folder `balls_n4_t60_s50000_m` in the `data/` folder. 
```shell
> cd src/js
> node demo/js/generate.js -e balls -n 4 -t 60 -s 50000 -m
```
This is an example of generating 50000 trajectories of 2 balls over 60 timesteps for wall geometry "U." It will create a folder `walls_n2_t60_s50000_wU` in the `data/` folder.
```shell
> cd src/js
> node demo/js/generate.js -e walls -n 2 -t 60 -s 50000 -w U
```

It takes quite a bit of time to generate 50000 trajectories, so 200
trajectories is enough for debugging purposes. In that case you may want to
change the flags accordingly in the examples below.

### Visualization
Trajectory data is stored in a `.json` file. You can visualize the trajectory by opening `src/js/demo/render.html` in your browser and passing in the `.json` file.


### Training the Model
This is an example of training the model for the `balls_n4_t60_s50000_m` dataset. The model checkpoints are saved in `src/lua/logs/balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m__balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_lr0.0003_modelnpe_seed0`. If you are comfortable looking at code that has not been cleaned up yet, please check out the flags in `src/lua/main.lua`. 
```shell
> cd src/lua
> th main.lua -layers 5 -dataset_folders "{'balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m'}" -nbrhd -rs -test_dataset_folders "{'balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m'}" -fast -lr 0.0003 -model npe -seed 0 -name balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m__balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_lr0.0003_modelnpe_seed0 -mode exp
```

Here is an example of training on 3, 4, 5 balls of variable mass and testing on 6, 7, 8 balls of variable mass, provided that those datasets have been generated. The model checkpoints are saved in `src/lua/logs/balls_n3_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n5_t60_ex50000_m__balls_n6_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n7_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n8_t60_ex50000_m_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_lr0.0003_modelnpe_seed0`.
```shell
> cd src/lua
> th main.lua -layers 5 -dataset_folders "{'balls_n3_t60_ex50000_m','balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m','balls_n5_t60_ex50000_m'}" -nbrhd -rs -test_dataset_folders "{'balls_n6_t60_ex50000_m','balls_n7_t60_ex50000_m','balls_n8_t60_ex50000_m'}" -fast -lr 0.0003 -model npe -seed 0 -name balls_n3_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n5_t60_ex50000_m__balls_n6_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n7_t60_ex50000_m,balls_n8_t60_ex50000_m_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_lr0.0003_modelnpe_seed0 -mode exp
```

Here is an example of training on "O" and "I" wall geometries and testing on "U" and "I" wall geometries, provided that those datasets have been generated. The model checkpoints are saved in `src/lua/logs/walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wO,walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wL__walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wU,walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wI_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_lr0.0003_modelnpe_seed0`.
```shell
> cd src/lua
> th main.lua -layers 5 -dataset_folders "{'walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wO','walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wL'}" -nbrhd -rs -test_dataset_folders "{'walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wU','walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wI'}" -fast -lr 0.0003 -model npe -seed 0 -name walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wO,walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wL__walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wU,walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wI_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_lr0.0003_modelnpe_seed0 -mode exp 
```

Be sure to look at the command line flags in `main.lua` for more details. You
may want to change the number of training iterations if you are just debugging
. The code defaults to cpu, but you can switch to gpu with the `-cuda` flag.
