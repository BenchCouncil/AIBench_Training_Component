# ResNet for Image Classification

This ResNet-TensorFlow implementation is from tensorflow official models, see https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official 

## Environment

Tensorflow 1.12

Cuda 9.0

Cudnn 7.4.2

## Dataset

ImageNet ILSVRC2012 Dataset 

## How to run

### 1.Prepare Dataset
You need to download ImageNet ILSVRC2012 Dataset  from http://www.image-net.org/ï¼Œ then you should convet these raw images to TFRecords by using build_imagenet_data.py script.

### 2.Start running

python imagenet_main.py --data_dir=/path/to/imagenet

Both the training dataset and the validation dataset are in the same directory. 
The model will begin training and will automatically evaluate itself on the validation data roughly once per epoch.

Some options:

--model_dir: to choose where to store the model 

--resnet_size: to choose the model size (options include ResNet-18 through ResNet-200)

--num-gpus: to choose computing device 

            0: Use OneDeviceStrategy and train on CPU
            
            1: Use OneDeviceStrategy and train on GPU.
            
            2+: Use MirroredStrategy (data parallelism) to distribute a batch between devices.

Full list of options, see resnet_run_loop.py
