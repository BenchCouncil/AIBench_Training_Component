# GANs comparison without cherry-picking

Implementations of some theoretical generative adversarial nets: DCGAN, EBGAN, LSGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, BEGAN, DRAGAN and CoulombGAN. 

I implemented the structure of model equal to the structure in paper and compared it on the CelebA dataset and LSUN dataset without cherry-picking.

## Features

- Model architectures are same as the architectures proposed in each paper
- Each model was not much tuned, so the results can be improved
- Well-structured (was my goal at the start, but I don't know whether it succeed!)
    - TensorFlow queue runner is used for input pipeline
    - Single trainer (and single evaluator) - multi model structure
    - Logs in training and configuration are recorded on the TensorBoard

## Models

- DCGAN
- LSGAN
- WGAN
- WGAN-GP
- EBGAN
- BEGAN
- DRAGAN
- CoulombGAN

The family of conditional GANs are excluded (CGAN, acGAN, and so on). 

## Dataset 

### CelebA

http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

- All experiments were performed on 64x64 CelebA dataset
- The dataset has 202599 images
- 1 epoch consists of about 1.58k iterations for batch size 128

### LSUN bedroom

http://lsun.cs.princeton.edu/2017/

- The dataset has 3033042 images
- 1 epoch consists of about 23.7k iterations for batch size 128

This dataset is provided in [LMDB](http://www.lmdb.tech/) format. https://github.com/fyu/lsun provides documentation and demo code to use it. 

## Results

- I implemented the same as the proposed model in each paper, but ignored some details (or the paper did not describe details of model)
  - Granted, a little details make great differences in the results due to the very unstable GAN training
  - So if you had a better results, let me know the settings ðŸ™‚
- Default batch_size=128 and z_dim=100 (from DCGAN)

### DCGAN

Radford, Alec, Luke Metz, and Soumith Chintala. "Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06434 (2015).

- Relatively simple networks
- Learning rate for discriminator (D_lr) is 2e-4 and learning rate for generator (G_lr) is 2e-4 (proposed in the paper) and 1e-3

|                G_lr=2e-4                 |                G_lr=1e-3                 |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|                   50k                    |                   30k                    |
| ![dcgan.G2e-4.50k](assets/celeba/dcgan.G2e-4.50k.png) | ![dcgan.G1e-3.30k](assets/celeba/dcgan.G1e-3.30k.png) |

Second row (50k, 30k) indicates each training iteration.

Higher learning rate (1e-3) for generator made better results. In this case, however, the generator has been collapsed sometimes due to its large learning rate. Lowering both learning rate may bring stability like https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/cats/ in which suggested D_lr=5e-5 and G_lr=2e-4.

### EBGAN

Zhao, Junbo, Michael Mathieu, and Yann LeCun. "Energy-based generative adversarial network." arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.03126 (2016).

- I like energy concept, so this paper is very interesting for me :)
  - But there is criticism: [Are Energy-Based GANs any more energy-based than normal GANs?](http://www.inference.vc/are-energy-based-gans-actually-energy-based/)
- Anyway, the energy concept and autoencoder based loss function are impressive, and the results are also fine
- But I have a question for Pulling-away Term (PT), which prevents mode-collapse theoretically. This is the same idea as minibatch discrimination (T. Salimans et al).


|             pt weight = 0.1              |                No pt loss                |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|                   30k                    |                   30k                    |
| ![ebgan.pt.30k](assets/celeba/ebgan.pt.30k.png) | ![ebgan.nopt.30k](assets/celeba/ebgan.nopt.30k.png) |

The model using PT generates slightly better sample visually. However, it is not clear from this results whether PT prevents mode-collapse. Furthermore, I could not distinguish what setting is better from repeated experiments.


|             pt weight = 0.1              |                No pt loss                |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| ![ebgan.pt.graph](assets/celeba/ebgan.pt.graph.png) | ![ebgan.nopt.graph](assets/celeba/ebgan.nopt.graph.png) |

pt_loss decreases a little faster in the left which used pt_weight=0.1 but there is no big difference and even at the end the right which used no pt_loss showed a lower pt_loss. So I wonder: is the PT loss really working for preventing mode-collapse as described in the paper?

### LSGAN

Mao, Xudong, et al. "Least squares generative adversarial networks." arXiv preprint ArXiv:1611.04076 (2016).

- Unusually, LSGAN used large latent space dimension (z_dim=1024)
- But in my experiment, z_dim=100 makes better results than z_dim=1024 which is originally used in paper

|                z_dim=100                 |                z_dim=1024                |

### WGAN

Arjovsky, Martin, Soumith Chintala, and LÃ©on Bottou. "Wasserstein gan." arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.07875 (2017).

- The samples from WGAN are not that impressive - compared to the very impressive theory
- Also no specific network structure proposed, so DCGAN architecture was used for experiments
- In the [author's implementation](https://github.com/martinarjovsky/WassersteinGAN), they used higher n_critic in the early stage of training and per 500 iterations

|                   30k                   |                W distance                |

### WGAN-GP

Gulrajani, Ishaan, et al. "Improved training of wasserstein gans." arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00028 (2017).

- I tried two network architectures, which are DCGAN architecture and ResNet architecture in appendix C
- ResNet has more complicated architecture and better performance than DCGAN architecture
- The interesting thing is that the visual quality of samples improves very quickly (ResNet WGAN-GP has best samples on 7k iterations) and it gets worse when continue training
- According to DRAGAN, constraints of WGAN are too restrictive to learn good generator

|            DCGAN architecture            |           ResNet architecture            |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|                   30k                    |           7k, batch size = 64            |

#### Face collapse phenomenon

WGAN-GP was collapsed more than other models when the iteration increases.

**DCGAN architecture**

|                   10k                    |                   20k                    |                   30k                    |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |

**ResNet architecture**

ResNet architecture showed the best visual quality sample in the very early stage, 7k iteration in my criteria. This maybe due to the residual architecture.

batch_size=64.

|                    5k                    |                    7k                    |                   10k                    |                   15k                    |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| ![wgan-gp.good.5k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.5k.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.7k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.7k.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.10k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.10k.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.15k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.15k.png) |
|                   20k                    |                   25k                    |                   30k                    |                   40k                    |
| ![wgan-gp.good.20k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.20k.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.25k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.25k.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.30k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.30k.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.40k](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.40k.png) |

Regardless of the face collapse phenomenon, the Wasserstein distance decreased steadily. It should come from that the critic (discriminator) network failed to find the supremum and K-Lipschitz function.

|            DCGAN architecture            |           ResNet architecture            |
| :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| ![wgan-gp.dcgan.w_dist](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.dcgan.w_dist.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.w_dist](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.w_dist.png) |
| ![wgan-gp.dcgan.w_dist.expand](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.dcgan.w_dist.expand.png) | ![wgan-gp.good.w_dist.expand](assets/celeba/wgan-gp.good.w_dist.expand.png) |

The plots in the last row of the table are just expanded version of the plots in the second row.

It is interesting that W_dist < 0 at the end of the training. This indicates that E[fake] > E[real] and, in the point of original GAN view, it means the generator dominates the discriminator. 

### BEGAN

Berthelot, David, Tom Schumm, and Luke Metz. "Began: Boundary equilibrium generative adversarial networks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.10717 (2017).

- The best model that generates samples with the best visual quality as far as I know
- It also showed the best performance in this project
  - Even though optional improvements was not implemented (section 3.5.1 in the paper)
- However, the samples generated by BEGAN give a slightly different feel from other models - it seems like disappearing details.
- So I just wonder what the results are for different datasets

batch_size=16, z_dim=64, gamma=0.5.

|                   30k                    |                   50k                    |                   75k                    |

|         Convergence measure M         |
| :-----------------------------------: |
| ![began.M](assets/celeba/began.M.png) |

I also tried to reduce speck-like artifacts as suggested in [Heumi/BEGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/Heumi/BEGAN-tensorflow/), but it did not go away. 

<!-- #### Speck-like artifacts phenomenon

As you can see above results, the samples of BEGAN has speckle artifacts. It can be reduced by adjusting gamma.

| gamma=0.3 | gam  |

BEGAN in the LSUN datset works terribly. Not only severe mode-collapse was observed, but also generated images were not realistic.

|                   LSUN                   |                   LSUN                   |

| ![began.200k](assets/lsun/began.200k.png) | ![began.250k](assets/lsun/began.250k.png) |


### DRAGAN

Kodali, Naveen, et al. "How to Train Your DRAGAN." arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.07215 (2017).

- Different with other papers, DRAGAN was motivated from the game theory for improving performance of GAN
- This approach through the game theory is highly unique and interesting
- But, IMHO, there is not much real contribution. The algorithm is similar to WGAN-GP

|            DCGAN architecture            |
| :--------------------------------------: |
|                   120k                   |
| ![dragan.30k](assets/celeba/dragan.fixed.120k.png) |

The original paper has some bugs. One of those is image x is pertured only positive-sided. I applied two-sided perturbation as the author admitted this bug on the [GitHub](https://github.com/kodalinaveen3/DRAGAN).

|                   LSUN                   |
| :--------------------------------------: |

| ![dragan.200k](assets/lsun/dragan.200k.png) |

### CoulombGAN

Unterthiner, Thomas, et al. "Coulomb GANs: Provably Optimal Nash Equilibria via Potential Fields." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.08819 (2017).

- CoulombGAN has also very interesting perspective - "Coulomb potential".
- It is very interesting but I don't know whether it is GAN.
- CoulombGAN tried to solve the diversity problem (mode collapse)


G_lr=5e-4, D_lr=25e-5, z_dim=32.

|            DCGAN architecture            |
| :--------------------------------------: |
|                   200k                   |
| ![coulombgan.200k](assets/celeba/coulombgan.200k.png) |

The disadvantage of this model is that it takes a very long time to train despite the simplicity of network architecture. Further, like original GAN, there is no convergence measure. I thought that the potentials of fake samples served as a convergence measure, but it did not.



<!--## Conclusion

- BEGAN showed the best performance for CelebA
  - But it works terrible for LSUN dataset
  - I wonder if it works great only for face datasets and why
- WGAN-GP showed the best performance for LSUN
- BEGAN and WGAN-GP have the most complex network structure
- It is difficult to rank models except BEGAN due to the lack of quantitative measure. The visual quality of generated samples from each model seemed similar.
- Conversely speaking, there have been a lot of GANs since DCGAN, but there is not a lot of significant improvement in visual quality ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
